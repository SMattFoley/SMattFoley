Hi, I’m Matt Foley I'm a Junior at the University of Connecticut studying computer science. I'm aspiring to enter the software development feild and am seeking an internship for the summer 24 season. I set up this Github page with the intent to display some of my coding work that I've done inside and outside of the classroom.
